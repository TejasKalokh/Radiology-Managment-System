                                A USG Prostate, or Prostate Ultrasound, is a specialized imaging technique designed to assess the size,
                                shape, and condition of the prostate gland. This non-invasive procedure employs sound waves to generate
                                real-time images of the prostate, offering valuable insights for diagnosing and monitoring various prostate-related conditions.
                                It is particularly effective in identifying prostate enlargement (benign prostatic hyperplasia), tumors, cysts,
                                and other abnormalities. The procedure is commonly recommended for individuals experiencing urinary issues,
                                pelvic discomfort, or abnormal blood test results related to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.

                                The USG Prostate scan is crucial for early detection of prostate cancer, providing a detailed view of the
                                glandâ€™s structure. It is often combined with a biopsy procedure to obtain tissue samples for further examination.
                                Our expert radiologists ensure precision during the scan, guaranteeing an accurate diagnosis with minimal discomfort.
                                Patients undergoing this procedure may be asked to maintain a full bladder for optimal visualization. With our advanced
                                ultrasound technology and experienced medical staff, we strive to deliver detailed assessments that support effective
                                treatment planning for prostate-related concerns.
