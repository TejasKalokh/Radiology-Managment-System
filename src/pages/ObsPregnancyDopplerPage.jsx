                The Obstetric (Obs) Pregnancy Doppler scan is a specialized ultrasound examination that evaluates blood flow in the uterus, placenta, and umbilical cord during pregnancy. This non-invasive procedure provides crucial information about the well-being of the fetus by assessing blood circulation, oxygen levels, and potential complications such as fetal growth restriction or placental insufficiency. The scan is highly valuable for monitoring high-risk pregnancies, ensuring the baby receives adequate oxygen and nutrients, and guiding appropriate medical interventions. By offering real-time insights into maternal and fetal circulation, the Obs Pregnancy Doppler scan is essential in safeguarding maternal and fetal health throughout pregnancy.
